This is my first project that i created a while ago for my 5th semester of cs..

I have used Google Sheets API from google cloud console for this project, This facilitaes data insertion into a google sheet in a customisable approach..

And i have used pythonanywhere.com for scheduling the py script for running once in 24 hrs..

use any data visualization tool of your choice for creating a dashboard that we can embed in our website (i had used tableau but it requires paid subscription for dynamic visualization.. so you can use any other tool if you want)
